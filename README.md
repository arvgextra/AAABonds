### Abstract

With a higher market capitalization than the equities market, the bond market is the biggest sector in the
stock market. Every business day, millions of dollars in bonds are traded mainly by institutional investors
with the goal of preserving and acquiring money by exposing their assets to a lower risk than with
equities. The most volatile subset of assets in the bond market are high yield corporate bonds. Bond prices
often have a higher relationship to underlying economic conditions than equities. for this reason we will
be assessing which economic indicators have a higher impact or relationship to high yield corporate
bonds. Specifically we will be focusing on AAA-rated corporate bonds, representing the highest credit
quality debt instruments issued by corporations. These bonds are considered very low risk and are given
the highest credit rating by credit rating agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch.
This project explores how different economic indicators such as GDP, CPI, unemployment, and interest
rates, play into the price of AAA rated corporate bonds. The goal is first to identify the factors that have
the biggest impact on the price of AAA rated corporate bonds using regressions on each of the indicators
individually. Then using this information we will incorporate the most influential factors into a multiple
polynomial regression to try and create a model to predict the price of AAA corporate bonds.

Our two guiding questions are:
1. Which economic indicators have the most pronounced linear relationship with AAA rated corporate bond
prices?
2. How can we create a model that predicts the price movements of AAA rated corporate bonds before they
occur, utilizing economic indicators for assessment?

This model attempts to predict AAA rated bond prices using the economic indicators of, GDP, CPI,
unemployment rate, and interest rate. It successfully fits each of the indicators with a polynomial
regression of appropriate degree. [LINK] Our multiple polynomial regression model was successful in
producing an r^2 of 0.91, meaning 91% of the variance in the dependent bond prices were explained by
the economic indicators we chose to predict it with.
